This is a human-readable summary of the Legal Code (the full license).

 

Disclaimer This Deed is not a license. It is simply a handy reference for understanding the Legal Code (the full license) — it is a human-readable expression of some of its key terms. Think of it as the user-friendly interface to the Legal Code beneath. This Deed itself has no legal value, and its contents do not appear in the actual license.

 

Even Yet Still More Disclaimer This license is derived from the Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-SA-3.0 license and the Apache License 2.0, for both of which we're very thankful. (They're fine with derivative uses.) Where this document links to Creative Commons it's only because they have an excellent explanation of the terms used here, or to give them credit. This is, however, NOT A CREATIVE COMMONS LICENSE, and they shouldn't be blamed for any shortcomings or evisceration of their work.

This License, like the original, is itself released under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license. Both Creative Commons and the Vizsage Project want you to know that each is not a law firm and do not provide legal services. Distributing of, displaying of, or linking to thie Vizsage Public License's Deed does not create an attorney-client relationship. You're a chump if you adapt this without proper legal advice.

How to Apply this license To apply the Vizsage Public License to your work, attach the following boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]" replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include the brackets!) The text should be enclosed in the appropriate comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a file or class name and description of purpose be included on the same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier identification within third-party archives.
